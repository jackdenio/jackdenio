## Hi there!

### My name is DÃªnio and I started working with web development in 2006 (<spam> <a href="https://skillicons.dev"> <img src="https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=html,css,js,php" width="100px"/> </a></spam>).

### From 2012 to 2019 I worked at an educational institution managing the IT sector, assisting in the implementation of the ERP RM TOTVS, networks, operational and web software.

### I went back to studying programming in 2018, and to developing in 2019 focusing on Laravel and VueJS. Today I work with systems administration, integrations and web development.

### I took some courses and bootcamps based on NodeJS and React, and I am currently studying and participating in a project with Symfony.
